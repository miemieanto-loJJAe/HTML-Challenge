The coldest and hottests months were months 3 and 8 respectively. It is very clear that humans would likely not survive in Mars as the temperature is always in the negatives

The month with the lowest atmospheric pressure was month 6 and the month with the highest atmospheric pressure is month 9

After plotting the line graph, we can see peaks and trophs. This indicates that there is a cycle happening where the weather goes from hot(peak) to cold(troph). Meaning that one full cycle of hot to hot is likey a year. The second peak is a approx 750 and the third peak is approx 1425. If you subtract them you get 675 as the approx number of earth days in a martian year.
